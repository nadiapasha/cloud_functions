# Mini Project showcasing Cloud Functions usage
This project is a simple To-Do List application. The fornt-end is built using Flask and the back-end involves Cloud Fucntions. For storage I will use Firestore to keep all tools on the same platform. The application will allow users to add, view, and delete to-do items.
